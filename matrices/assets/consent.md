# Consent and Authorization Document

You are invited to participate in a research study. Please read this consent form carefully, along with the provided summary. Take the time to ask any questions you may have and ensure you fully understand the study before deciding whether to participate.

#### Purpose of the Study

While network data is increasingly common, the visualization of multi-attribute networks remains underexplored. This study assesses the effectiveness of an encoding technique for visualizing the mean and standard deviation of links in adjacency matrices.

#### Risks to study participants

Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analysis. As such, your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will not be used to identify you.

#### Benefits to research participants and others

There may be no direct benefit to research participants. The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data visualization, along with helping inform the development of future data exploration platforms.
